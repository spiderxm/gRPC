## gRPC 
Used gRPC for the first time, and it was a amazing developer experience.
Edge points of using gPRC which I felt:
- Structured Code
- Uniform request placing mechanism
- Using streams is so easy
- Request Payload requires less space as it is binary encoded.
- Reduced network latency verified using benchmark testing
